So I'm starting a new blog.

I've had this domain for quite a while but haven't actually used it
for anything until recently when I setup this page using
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
I haven't blogged in a long time but if anyone is interested in my
old posts from about 2-3 years ago, feel free to visit my old website,
which is still online: [Click Here](http://www.adztec-independent.de)

I'm not planning on updating that website anymore. Instead I'll start
writing stuff mostly related to [Fancy](http://fancy-lang.org) here,
including, but not limited to, tutorials, current developments and
other noteworthy news related to the language and its ecosystem.

I probably should have done this a lot sooner, but up to now I focused
more on working on the language itself, fixing bugs, adding features
and making it more stable overall.

Fancy has matured quite a bit over the past 2.5 years since its
inception and it's now at a point where I consider it at beta
stage. It's not yet 100% production ready but from what I can say from
personal experience using the language on a daily basis now,
it's definitely getting there.

Fancy's website definitely needs an overhaul, but unfortunately I
really suck at website design so if anyone is interested helping me
out on that part, I'd really appreciate that. I might end up coming up
with a new design myself some time soon, though. We'll see.

Any feedback and suggestions are welcome of course.
